    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
    I like to kick ass. Give me any project, and I'll give 110% effort every time in order to make things succeed. I'm a workhorse and love slugging through tough projects that require a balance of creativity and tenacity to get through the monkey-work. My greatest pleasure is seeing things work well and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p>
    I brand myself as a full stack developer who loves writing OOP code all-day either back-end or front-end. I've got a firm grounding in UI as I was also a graphic designer for a number of years. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Learning is a big part of my life, and I spend most of my spare time taking formal classes, or learning new technologies that'll help me rock out with the next big project.
    </p>

    <h3>Proudest Achievement</h3>
    <p>
    Getting nasty with VIM...I swear by it now. My fingers have never felt so useful.
    </p>

    <h3>Secret Superpower</h3>
    <p>
    I'm a DIYer. I brew beer throughout the year and make sausage every Xmas.
