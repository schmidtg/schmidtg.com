    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
    Give me any project, and I'll give 110% effort every time in order to make things succeed. My greatest pleasure is seeing things work well and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p>
    I brand myself as a full stack developer who loves writing OOP code all-day either back-end or front-end. I was also a graphic designer for a number of years, so I've got a firm grounding in UI.
    </p>

    <p>
    Learning is a big part of my life, and I spend much of my spare time taking formal classes, or learning new technologies that'll help me rock out with the next big project.
    </p>

    <h3>
    Proudest Achievement
    </h3>
    <p>
    VIM...I swear by it now. Shortcuts have never felt so useful.
    </p>

    <h3>
    Fun Fact
    </h3>
    <p>
    Currently my wife and I call the great city of Boston home,  but my favorite time of year is flying home to the Canadian prairies to make homemade sausage with my family every Xmas.
