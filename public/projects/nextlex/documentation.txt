OVERVIEW
****************
Based on your location, determine when the next Lexpress Bus will be making a scheduled stop. Look up route maps, scheduled stop times, and walking directions for each stop.

****************
CONFIGURATION
****************
1. Setup a localhost database, and load the SQL file: ''nextlex.sql' (located in 'sql' directory)
2. Update the DATABASE, USERNAME and PASSWORD info in /inc/constants.php
3. Update where the SERVER is located (default is 'localhost') and provide a base url, BASE_URL.

USAGE
****************

Random Location - 0 or 1
Because this mobile web-app is geolocation based, I created a 'random' mode to choose a random geoposition within 1 mile of the main Depot. Please toggle this setting in the .init() configuration under 'views/main.php' by chooseing '0' (use your current geolocation) or '1' (use a random location within 1 mile).

Current Time
Lexpress operates between 6:30am and 6pm. Using the app outside of these hours will yield no results for the next stop.

****************
ORGANIZATION
****************
I structured this app similarly to the basic framework provided by the last CS50 project with a few modifications:

|~css/
   Where the CSS files and related images are located. I'm also using jQuery Mobile which fetches a CSS file from the web.

|~images/
   Location of various markers for the map. I created these in Photoshop and kept the raw PSDs for any future edits.

|~inc/
  |-config.php - include files for PHP app
  |-constants.php - allow you to configure base constants in use in the PHP app
  |-functions.php - shared helper files (e.g. query())

|~iphone/
   Preview of app loaded in iframe. NOTE: You must change the iframe URL to your BASE_URL in order to view this.

|~js/
  |-main.js - Main javascript file.
  |+lib/
    |-handlebars-1.0.rc.1.js - javascript template framework

|~models/
  |-nextlex.php - PHP methods that use SQL queries to fetch and return data in JSON format

|~seeds/
  |-data.csv - the original data feed I was provided by the Town of Lexington
  |-seeds.php - some PHP functions I wrote to assist populating my DB table

|~sql/
  |-nextlex.sql - DB dump of need tables for Next Lexpress app

|~views/
  |-main.php - Main PHP view that gets loaded to display single-page app.

index.php - main controller for app
